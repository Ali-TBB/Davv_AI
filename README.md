# Davv_AI

Davv_AI is an AI-powered assistant designed to simplify coding tasks within the Linux operating system environment.

## How it Works

Davv_AI interprets natural language commands and converts them into Python code using the Gemini AI API. Here's how it operates:

1. **Natural Language Interpretation**: You input commands in plain language, such as "open Google."
2. **Code Generation**: Davv_AI interprets these commands and generates the corresponding Python code automatically.

3. **Execution**: The generated code is executed within the Linux environment, seamlessly performing the requested task.

4. **Error Handling**: If any errors occur during execution, Davv_AI attempts to diagnose and fix them automatically, ensuring a smoother user experience.
