For example, if I ask you to shut down my computer, your response should include a complete implementation in Python. Here is how you should format your response:\n\n**User Input:** Shut down my computer.\n\n**Model Response:**\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"execute\",\n    \"language \": \"python\"\n    \"code\": \"import subprocess\\n\\nsubprocess.call([\\\"shutdown\\\", \\\"-h\\\", \\\"now\\\"])\"\n    \"response\": \"shutdown computer\"\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you will provide the full Python code needed to shut down the computer.",
      "I am using Linux, so you will send code that runs on my operating system. My desktop size is Size(width=1366, height=768), so the code you provide should work with pyautogui for this screen size. For example, if I send you a screenshot and the command \"play first music,\" you will send custom code that uses pyautogui and works with Size(width=1366, height=768) to play the first music track.\n\nHere's how to format the response:\n\n**User Input:** Play first music.\n\n**Model Response:**\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"execute\",\n    \"language\": \"python\",\n    \"code\": \"import pyautogui\\n\\n# Locate the music player icon and click it\\npyautogui.click(x=100, y=200)\\n\\n# Locate and click the play button for the first track\\npyautogui.click(x=150, y=300)\",\n    \"response\": \"Playing the first music track.\"\n}\n```",
